                'To enhance early prediction accuracy for Li-ion battery health and lifespan, many have turned to feature-based machine-learning. We presents a novel nonlinear state-space model named Enhanced Gaussian Process Dynamical Model. We adopt a generalized kernel substitution for better covariance in observables and latent coordinates, merging it with transfer learning to forecast health up to end-of-life. This model doesnâ€™t need feature values beyond existing data and utilizes transfer learning for optimal hyperparameters from related battery data. Our approach outperforms leading algorithms, including Gaussian process and deep networks, especially in early battery stages.',

            descriptions:
                'The Gaussian Process Dynamical Model (GPDM) is a powerful method that combines the non-parametric flexibility of Gaussian Processes (GPs) with the temporal coherence of dynamical models. The task performed by GPDM is to initialize high-dimensional observations into a lower-dimensional latent space. It utilizes a dynamic GP (dGP) to autoregressively generate predictive values and then maps them back to the high-dimensional observation space using an observation GP (oGP). This tutorial aims to provide an in-depth understanding of how to implement GPDMs and its transfer learning ability, particularly in the realm of time-series data analysis.',
